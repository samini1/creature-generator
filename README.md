# Tehvi's Fluxstream Observatory

This is a simple creature card generator which utilizes basic Javascript and CSS. The Wordnik API and a series of arrays are used to randomly generate text which describes a hypothetical creature. The card text also converts to a textarea on click to allow the user to add additional information and correct grammatical issues caused by the free version of the API's less robust filtering capabilities.  

Some work will be done in the future to organize the code better, implement an independent random word library which does not cause inconsintencies, and allow the user to save cards to a profile, as well as generally improve the aesthetic quality of the site.
